MMF-Android-RemoteControl-SDK
=============================

This SDK will allow developers to build applications that control and display data from the MMF Android apps.

We have included a sample app that uses the library, and javadocs for the library.

There is also a compiled sample app, and MapMyRun 3.0.6 Beta that has the necessary changes to work with the SDK.
