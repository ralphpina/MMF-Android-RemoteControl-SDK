MMF-Android-RemoteControl-SDK
=============================

This SDK will allow developers to build applications that control and display data from the MMF Android apps.

We have included a sample app that uses the library, and javadocs for the library.

There is also a compiled sample app, and MapMyRun 3.0.6 Beta that has the necessary changes to work with the SDK.

Since the SDK is being used for Android, it needs to be compiled with Java 1.6. This means that Java 1.6 must be installed in the computer, and that you need to make sure you are compiling it with that version.

To check the version of java:
$ javac -version

To compile your classes you also need to include the Android classes. So inside of the folder with the SDK classes you can execute:

$ javac -target 1.6 -d classes/ -cp /usr/local/android-sdk/platforms/android-19/android.jar *.java

The above assumes you have a folder named "classes" where you'll be putting the .class files generated by the command. It also assumes that your Android SDK is located at the path above.

Lastly, we need to package the .class files into a JAR. To do this execute the command:

$ jar cf < name for file >.jar *

That will package all the classes in the current directory.
